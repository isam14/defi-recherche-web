Par qui?

Most people consider these two people the inventors of the Internet:

Yogen Dalal and Carl Sunshine

Quand et où?

The Internet as we know it today first started being developed in the late 1960's in California in the United States.

Pourquoi?

The initial idea of the Internet is credited to Leonard Kleinrock after he published his first paper entitled "Information Flow in Large Communication Nets" on May 31, 1961.

2- Quelle est la différence entre le Web et Internet ?

The Internet, linking your computer to other computers around the  world, is a way of transporting content. The Web is software that lets  you use that content…or contribute your own. The Web, running on the  mostly invisible Internet, is what you see and click on in your  computer’s browser.

The Internet’s roots are in the U.S. during the late 1960s. The Web  was invented 20 years later by an Englishman working in  Switzerland—though it had many predecessors.

To keep things “interesting,” many people use the term Internet to refer to both.
